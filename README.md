# Automating CI/CD Pipeline using GitHub Actions and Docker for a Web Application 
-This project is focused on demonstrating a complete CI/CD pipeline for a Python-based Flask webapplication. 
-The application is first containerized using Docker to ensure environment consistency across development and production.
-The GitHub repository is integrated with GitHub Actions, which automatically triggers workflows upon code push events.
-Once the pipeline passes all checks, the application is automatically deployed to the Render platform, a cloud-based hosting solution that supports Dockerized deployments.
